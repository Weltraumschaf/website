Many web sites allow users to log in with their Facebook or Google
account. This so-called Web single sign-on (SSO) often uses the
standard protocols OAuth and OpenID Connect. How secure are these
protocols? What can go wrong?

OAuth and OpenID Connect do not protect your privacy at all, i.e.,
your identity provider (e.g., Facebook or Google) can always track,
where you log in. Mozilla tried to create an authentication protocol
that aimed to prevent tracking: BrowserID (a.k.a. Persona). Did their
proposition really solve the privacy issue? What are the lessons
learned and can we do better?

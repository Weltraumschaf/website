[Secure Cologne
Talks](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Secure-Cologne-Talks/) is a meetup
series initiated and organized by [Spike
Reply](https://www.reply.com/de/). This event was sponsored by
[yesÂ®](https://yes.com).


This talk is an extended version of my talk at [Froscon
2019](/publications/2019-08-10-how-not-to-use-oauth/). Most
importantly, the AS Mix-Up attack is covered as well.


Note: Some animation steps were lost during the PDF export.

<p>Hi, I'm Daniel Fett, a web security researcher and security specialist at <a href="https://yes.com">yes.com</a>. I've got a PhD degree from the University of Stuttgart for my <a href="/publications/2018-10-19-an-expressive-formal-web-model/">research on the formal analysis of web protocols</a> and I work on <a href="/publications/2018-12-28-oauth-bcp/">improving the security of OAuth</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, I enjoy climbing, building electronic gadgets, photographing, and organizing events.</p>
